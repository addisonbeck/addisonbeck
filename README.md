### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

My name is Addison. I'm a husband, father of 4, and engineer/problem child
[@bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden).

I successfully make things sometimes, but mostly I break things and get upset.

I am primarily an experienced .NET and Typescript software engineer. These
days I like to work with Nix and Rust. I get really excited about Linux,
open source, terminals, text editors, plain text tools, and cryptids.

I love to plan, test, and write everything in life.
